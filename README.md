My simple desktop configuration:
- i3 as window manager
- i3status as a status bar
- picom as compositing manager
- dunst as notification manager
- xterm as terminal
- bemenu as a quick application launcher
A few scripts to:
- capture my screen
- set the wallpaper to the bing daily image
- add mic toggling, media, and graphic card information to the status bar
- change focus to any window
